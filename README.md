This repository demonstrates a common Perl error: accessing an array element beyond its defined index. The `bug.pl` file contains the erroneous code, while `bugSolution.pl` provides a corrected version.  The error results in undefined behavior and can lead to unexpected program crashes or incorrect results. The solution emphasizes safe array access using bounds checking.
